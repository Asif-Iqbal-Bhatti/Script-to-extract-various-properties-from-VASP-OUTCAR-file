# Python3 Script to extract Elastic properties, Energy, lattice parameter from VASP output files ðŸ’«
**_Convert VASP5 POSCAR Lattice Matrix to Lattice parameter and other properties_**

If you have performed a number of calculations and you want to obtain the lattice parameters and volume from each directory then run this script in a directory and it will loop over all the directory and find POSCAR files and output the lattice parameters and volume, moreover it also scans the CONTCAR files and compute the volume and lattice parameters, and on the screen it prints the volume difference upon structure minimization. 
For Elastic constants this gives an indication how much the cell has deformed and gives us the indication whether we need to increase ENCUT or KPOINTS to minimize the Pulay stress as indicated on VASP manual.

**USAGE** : Just run the Main_file.py it will call all the modules
_______________________
For VASP structural minimization these tag should be used: IBRION = 2; ISIF = 3; EDIFF= 10**-8

An excercise to print Cij matrix in a pythonic way

def print_Cij_Matrix():
	Bij = []
	C = "C"
	for i in range(0,6):
		Bij.append([])
		for j in range(0,6):
			Bij[i].append((C + str(i) + str(j)))
	l = np.matrix(Bij)		
	print (l)
 ```
